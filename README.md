# DatoCMS Dependent Fields plugin

This plugin is inspired be [Conditional Fields plugin]() created by DatoCMS team - kudos to them!

This plugin allows to show/hide field when some other field has certain value set.
Check the `invert` option if you want the plugin to act in the opposite way,
i.e. show slave field when master is false
